/**
 * This example configures a simple single region connection
 *
 * * Create the HA VPN gateway and a Cloud Router. This creates 2 public IP addresses on the GCP side.
 * * Create two AWS Virtual Private Gateways. This creates 4 public addresses on the AWS side.
 * * Create two AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections and customer gateways, one for each AWS Virtual Private Gateway. Specify a non-overlapping link-local Tunnel IP Range for each tunnel, 4 total. For example, 169.254.1.4/30.
 * * Download the AWS configuration files for the generic device type.
 * * Create four VPN tunnels on the HA VPN gateway.
 * * Configure BGP sessions on the Cloud Router using the BGP IP addresses from the downloaded AWS configuration files.
